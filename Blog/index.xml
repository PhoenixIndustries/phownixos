      <description>Manjaro is based on the independently developed Arch operating system. Within the Linux community, Arch itself is renowned for being an exceptionally fast, powerful, and lightweight distribution that provides access to the very latest cutting edge – and bleeding edge – software. However, Arch is also aimed at more experienced or technically-minded users. As such, it is generally considered to be beyond the reach of those who lack the technical expertise (or persistence) required to use it.</description>

      <description>Introduction After you downloaded Manjaro. This guide covers the basic&amp;rsquo;s, If you want more information look into the Manjaro User Guide or the Manjaro Wiki.
You downloaded Manjaro as an ISO file. An ISO file contains all files Manjaro needs to start an installation compressed into a handy file, which you can then use to make a DVD or USB-Stick that can be run by your computer. This file can be directly used by a virtual machine if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to try out Manjaro on your actual computer, yet.</description>

      <description>Manjaro&amp;rsquo;s repositories contain the latest available versions of popular software like the statistic language R, the scripting language Python and more. Also LaTeX, additional packages for it and software like Lyx or TeXstudio are readily available and can be installed with just a few clicks. With LaTeX scientists can create high-quality documents and presentations with included math-formulas, chemical molecules, self-updating cross- and literature references and more without being restrained by a specific style or document type.</description>

      <description>Manjaro comes preinstalled with Steam, so there&amp;rsquo;s no need to go to a website and download it manually. Installing drivers, updates and more applications is handled through the package manager and Manjaro Hardware Detection Tool that will do all operations in just a couple of minutes and never requires or forces a restart of the system, unless you update the kernel.
Due to the design of Linux, hardware like Gamepads are recognized instantaneously if drivers are available, so users don&amp;rsquo;t have to wait until it works.</description>

      <description>Manjaro&amp;rsquo;s repository of free and quality software is filled with programs for each subject. For mathematics, simple to advanced calculations can be done using scientific calculators like Qalculate! or SpeedCrunch that don&amp;rsquo;t just copy the experience of most hardware-calculators, but allow free editing of functions and terms.
For more complex mathematics, Cantor Teachers love Geogebra to show physics, trigonometry, vector operations and more for its easy-to-use graphical editing of mathematical relations, plotting of functions and setting constraints.</description>

      <description>Manjaro comes in many different editions, all with a unique workflow and user experience from a traditional desktop environment to window managers that are optimized for maximum performance and work efficiency.
The system is set up easily, while giving developers all the freedom and space to tinker when wanted. All tools to compile and develop software are pre installed. The integrated package manager allows easy installation of IDEs like Qt Creator, KDevelop or Netbeans and libraries like libnoise, boost or matplotlib.</description>

      <description>Manjaro comes pre installed with a collection of software that makes all daily tasks possible without even searching for them. If some application is not installed, more software can easily and securely be installed via the integrated package manager (software center): Just search for e.g. &amp;ldquo;Office&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Music&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Internet&amp;rdquo;, select or tick what should be installed and everything else will be done automatically for you.
All this software is also completely free and will be updated alongside Manjaro.</description>

      <description>Manjaro comes preinstalled with GIMP, a very powerful image manipulation program. For drawing Krita will fulfill most of your needs, while Darktable brings a top-notch and free photography suite. Vector-graphics can be done with programs such as Inkscape.
For simple or advanced video-editing, Kdenlive and OpenShot will do almost anything you need.
3D-Modelling can be done using Blender. Codecs for video and audio come pre-installed or are automatically fetched. Most of this software is freely available and can be easily and securely installed using Manjaro&amp;rsquo;s integrated package manager.</description>

      <description>Be secure  We encourage you to check if the download was not modified by some malicious person or by an error while downloading. As a simple check, you can generate the SHA1-sum of the downloaded file and compare it with the one we provide here. Here you can find information how to generate such a sum and check your downloaded files.
To even further enhance the security, verify the downloaded file with a GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) signature that will ensure that the file was not modified and was actually created by the Manjaro developers.</description>

      <description>There are two architectures available: 64 bit and 32 bit. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know which one you should choose, you can use 64 bit for more modern computers and 32 bit if your computer is an older model. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have enough information about your hardware, choose the 32 bit version, which will run on most hardware.
Both editions have exactly the same features and support and this decision is only important if you need maximum performance.</description>

      <description>Every person is different and needs an operating system that doesn&amp;rsquo;t try to enforce a specific workflow, visual style or certain programs. Manjaro comes with default settings, that we believe are helpful to most users. But as with most Linux distributions, you still have every option to configure, change, remove or replace whatever you like. Most of these options are directly available via an easy to use configuration program.</description>

      <description>As like many other Linux distributions, we believe that privacy, security and keeping control are among the most valuable things for a user. We have included some clever tools to accomplish everything needed to make room for actual work, entertainment and relaxation. But you, the user, will always be in control of your own computer.

      <description>The terminal is a very powerful tool that almost never fails to work and does exactly the things you want from it. You don&amp;rsquo;t click on something in the terminal - You insert a command and it will do what the command say. Many Linux users like to provide solutions via terminal as it&amp;rsquo;s completely independent from the user interface (which you can heavily modify).

      <description>When updates are available Manjaro will just show an unobtrusive notification. If you have important work to do, are currently in a ranked game or watching a movie, you can just hide it with one click. &amp;ldquo;Not now&amp;rdquo; for us still means that you don&amp;rsquo;t have time and don&amp;rsquo;t want to update right now. There are no hidden downloads or automatic restarts. Manjaro does exactly what you want.</description>

      <description>Manjaro does not send any data to anybody. Why should it? It&amp;rsquo;s your data and you decide what you want to do with it. You can decide if you want to use services that finance themselves with the data you generate. But you also can decide to secure, hide and protect your data and use open source software which is directly available in Manjaro&amp;rsquo;s repositories and has been additionally checked by the package maintainer.</description>
