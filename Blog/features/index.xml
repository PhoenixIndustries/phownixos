      <description>Manjaro is based on the independently developed Arch operating system. Within the Linux community, Arch itself is renowned for being an exceptionally fast, powerful, and lightweight distribution that provides access to the very latest cutting edge – and bleeding edge – software. However, Arch is also aimed at more experienced or technically-minded users. As such, it is generally considered to be beyond the reach of those who lack the technical expertise (or persistence) required to use it.</description>

      <description>Manjaro comes preinstalled with Steam, so there&amp;rsquo;s no need to go to a website and download it manually. Installing drivers, updates and more applications is handled through the package manager and Manjaro Hardware Detection Tool that will do all operations in just a couple of minutes and never requires or forces a restart of the system, unless you update the kernel.
Due to the design of Linux, hardware like Gamepads are recognized instantaneously if drivers are available, so users don&amp;rsquo;t have to wait until it works.</description>

      <description>Manjaro&amp;rsquo;s repository of free and quality software is filled with programs for each subject. For mathematics, simple to advanced calculations can be done using scientific calculators like Qalculate! or SpeedCrunch that don&amp;rsquo;t just copy the experience of most hardware-calculators, but allow free editing of functions and terms.
For more complex mathematics, Cantor Teachers love Geogebra to show physics, trigonometry, vector operations and more for its easy-to-use graphical editing of mathematical relations, plotting of functions and setting constraints.</description>

      <description>Manjaro comes in many different editions, all with a unique workflow and user experience from a traditional desktop environment to window managers that are optimized for maximum performance and work efficiency.
The system is set up easily, while giving developers all the freedom and space to tinker when wanted. All tools to compile and develop software are pre installed. The integrated package manager allows easy installation of IDEs like Qt Creator, KDevelop or Netbeans and libraries like libnoise, boost or matplotlib.</description>

      <description>Manjaro comes pre installed with a collection of software that makes all daily tasks possible without even searching for them. If some application is not installed, more software can easily and securely be installed via the integrated package manager (software center): Just search for e.g. &amp;ldquo;Office&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Music&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Internet&amp;rdquo;, select or tick what should be installed and everything else will be done automatically for you.
All this software is also completely free and will be updated alongside Manjaro.</description>

For simple or advanced video-editing, Kdenlive and OpenShot will do almost anything you need.
3D-Modelling can be done using Blender. Codecs for video and audio come pre-installed or are automatically fetched. Most of this software is freely available and can be easily and securely installed using Manjaro&amp;rsquo;s integrated package manager.</description>

      <description>Every person is different and needs an operating system that doesn&amp;rsquo;t try to enforce a specific workflow, visual style or certain programs. Manjaro comes with default settings, that we believe are helpful to most users. But as with most Linux distributions, you still have every option to configure, change, remove or replace whatever you like. Most of these options are directly available via an easy to use configuration program.</description>

      <description>As like many other Linux distributions, we believe that privacy, security and keeping control are among the most valuable things for a user. We have included some clever tools to accomplish everything needed to make room for actual work, entertainment and relaxation. But you, the user, will always be in control of your own computer. It&amp;rsquo;s your hardware and your operating system.</description>

      <description>Power-users and people who need special features of the Linux Kernel that don&amp;rsquo;t come with the default one, can just switch to a different Kernel with one click. Do you make music or need other realtime features? Just switch to an RT-Kernel. Do you need the newest improved open-source graphics drivers? Just switch to a newer one. Manjaro supports multiple installed Kernels at the same time. Just re-boot your system and make your selection in the boot menu.</description>

      <description>When updates are available Manjaro will just show an unobtrusive notification. If you have important work to do, are currently in a ranked game or watching a movie, you can just hide it with one click. &amp;ldquo;Not now&amp;rdquo; for us still means that you don&amp;rsquo;t have time and don&amp;rsquo;t want to update right now. There are no hidden downloads or automatic restarts. Manjaro does exactly what you want.</description>

      <guid>/features/under-your-control/your-data-not-ours/</guid>
      <description>Manjaro does not send any data to anybody. Why should it? It&amp;rsquo;s your data and you decide what you want to do with it. You can decide if you want to use services that finance themselves with the data you generate. But you also can decide to secure, hide and protect your data and use open source software which is directly available in Manjaro&amp;rsquo;s repositories and has been additionally checked by the package maintainer.</description>
